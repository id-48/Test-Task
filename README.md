# demo_ui

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I enhanced the user experience using Flutter animations, adding smooth transitions and effects
throughout the app. For state management, I used GetX, which made the app efficient and reactive.
The MVC structure was followed for better separation of concerns, ensuring modular and scalable
code. Icons and assets were placeholders, but I aimed to deliver a polished, professional design.
